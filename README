The emacs init file contained in this project is tested only in Windows and Linux with EMACS 23.3.1. You need to download the libraries/modules yourself. After you downloaded the libraries/modules, put them into the .emacs.d/lisp of your home dir. If you don't have lisp in .emacs.d, you have to create one. They will be loaded by the emacs when it was launched.
Here is a list of libraries/modules I have used:
* auto-complete
* browse-kill-ring
* color-theme
* quick-jump
* redo+
* sr-speedbar
* tabbar

The screen init file was tested with screen 4.03.01

The screen.sh init script was tested with my LFS.
